# Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's law quantifies the relationship between two electrically charged particles. It is useful for finding the electric field due to **point charges**.

### Magnitude of Force

$$|F| = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$

- $q_1$ is the magnitude of the first charge.
- $q_2$ is the magnitude of the second charge.
- $k_e = 8.988 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2 \cdot C^{-2} \text{}$
- $r$ is the distance between the two charges.

### Force Vector

$$\bold{F} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\bold{r}_{21}|^2} \hat{\bold{r}}_{21} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{|r_{21}|^2} \frac{\bold{r}_{21}}{|\bold{r}_{21}|}$$

- $q_1$ is the magnitude of the first charge.
- $q_2$ is the magnitude of the second charge.
- $k_e = 8.988 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2 \cdot C^{-2} \text{}$
- $r_{21}$ is the vector from $q_2$ to $q_1$.

# Biot-Savart Law

The Biot-Savart Law quantifies the generation of a magnetic field from a constant current carrying conductor.

$$d\bold{F}_m = md \bold{B} = m\mu_0 \frac{I dl \times a_R}{4\pi r^2}$$

# Lorentz Force

# Lenz's Law

Induced emf is in such a way that opposes the change in magnetic flux.

$$\bold{F} = q \bold{v} \times \bold{B}$$

$$\bold{B}(\bold{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int_c \frac{I d\bold{l} \times \bold{a}_R}{|a_R|^2} $$

# Electric Field

### Electric Field Intensity

$$\bold{E} = \frac{\bold{F}_2}{q} = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 R^2} \bold{r}$$

More generally,

$$\bold{E} = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{Q_i}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 R_i^2} \bold{a}_{R_i}$$

# Electric Flux

The electric flux eminating from a charged sphere is proportional to the total charge of the sphere.

$$\Phi_e = Q$$

### Electric Flux Density over Sphere

$$\bold{D} = \epsilon_0 \bold{E} = \frac{Q}{4 \pi r^2} \bold{a}_r$$

| Variable           | Meaning                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| $\epsilon_0$       | $8.854 \times 10^{-12} F \cdot m^2 \text{}$ |
| $\bold{E} \text{}$ | Electric Field Intensity                    |
| $\bold{a}_r$       | Direction of Electric Flux Density          |

### Electric Flux over Closed Surface $s$

$$\Phi_E = \oint_s \epsilon_0 \bold{E} \cdot d\bold{s} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}$$

# Maxwell's Equations

### Gauss's Law, Electric Flux

The electric flux eminating over a closed surface $s$ is equal to the charge.

#### Integral Form

$$\Phi_e = \oint_s \epsilon_0 \bold{E} \cdot d \bold{s} = \int_v \rho_v dv = Q$$

#### Differential Form

$$\nabla \cdot (\epsilon_0 \bold{E}) = \rho_v$$

### Gauss's Law, Magnetic Flux

The magnetic flux eminating over a closed surface $s$ is equal to zero.

Note:
- Because magnetic fields are closed, the magnetic flux is equal to zero.
- Isolated magnetic poles do not exist.

#### Integral Form

$$\Phi_b = \oint_s \bold{B} \cdot d \bold{s} = 0$$

#### Differential Form

$$\nabla \cdot \bold{B} = 0$$

### Faraday's Law of Induction

The induced electromagnetic force (voltage) over a closed contour $c$ is caused by the change in the magnetic flux over a surface $s$.

Note:
- The voltage resists the change in magnetic field, hence the negative sign.

#### Integral Form

$$\text{V} = \oint_c \bold{E} \cdot d\bold{l} = -\frac{d}{dt} \int_s \bold{B} \cdot d\bold{s}$$

#### Differential Form

$$\nabla \times \bold{E} = - \frac{\partial \bold{B}}{\partial t}$$

### Ampere's Law

The current over a closed contour $c$ is the current density over a surface $s$ and the change in magnetic flux over the surface $s$.

The term $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dt} \int_s \epsilon_0 \bold{E} \cdot d\bold{s}$ is often referred to as the "virtual current" because it is resistance of voltage to the change in electric flux.

#### Integral Form

$$I_{enc} = \oint_c \frac{\bold{B}}{\mu_0} \cdot d\bold{l} = \int_s \bold{J} \cdot d\bold{s} + \frac{d}{dt} \int_s \epsilon_0 \bold{E} \cdot d\bold{s}$$

#### Differential Form

$$\nabla \times \frac{\bold{B}}{\mu_0} = \bold{J} + \frac{\partial (\epsilon_0 \bold{E})}{\partial t}$$
