# Semiconductors

A semiconductor is one of the categories of materials that describe its electrical properties. It is in between a **conductor** and **insulator**.

### Elemental Semiconductor Materials

Elemental semiconductors are composed of an element, found in group $\text{IV}$ of the periodic table.

#### Examples

Silicon ($\text{Si}$), Germanium ($\text{Ge}$)

### Compound Semiconductor Materials (3-5 compound semiconductor material)

Compound semiconductors are composed of compounds (multiple elements) and are composed of combinations of group $\text{III}$ and group $\text{V} \text{}$.

#### Binary Compounds

Two elements. For example, $\text{AlP}$, $\text{AlAs}$, $\text{GaP}$, $\text{GaAs}$, $\text{InP}$.

#### Ternary Compounds

Three elements. For example $\text{Al} \text{G}_{a_{1-x}} \text{As}$.

# Types of Solids

### Amorphous

- No order
- No patterns

### Polycrystalline

- Order in some regions
- Patterns in some regions

### Crystalline (Single)

Well formed.

- Order
- Patterns

# Space Lattices

A lattice is the periodic arrangement of atoms.

### Unit Cell

- The smallest volume of crystal used to reproduce crystal.
- Repetitive arrangement can build up the crystal without overlap.
- Orthogonal
- For example, zinc blende, diamond lattice

### Primitive Cell

- Contains one **lattice point**.
- Smallest unit cell that can be repeated to form a lattice. Most basic cell of a lattice.
- Can be non-orthogonal or orthogonal.

# Crystal Structures

3D structure of crystals.

### Simple Cubic

- Atoms are in each corner.

### Body-Centered Cubic

- One atom is added in the center.

### Face-Centered Cubic

- Atoms are added on the faces.
- Each atom on the face contributes half of itself.

### Atomic Density

$$\text{Density} = \frac{\text{atoms}}{\text{volume of unit cell}}$$

# Vector Characterization of Planes, Direction

### Vector Characterization of Planes

$$\bar{r} = p \bar{r} + q \bar{b} + s \bar{c}$$

Representation of crystal planes.

1. Find the intercepts of $\bar{r} = p \bar{r} + q \bar{b} + s \bar{c}$ on the $\bar{a}$, $\bar{b}$ and $\bar{c}$ axes
2. Put it in the form $\displaystyle (\frac{1}{p}, \frac{1}{q}, \frac{1}{s})$
3. Find $\displaystyle \text{LCD}(\frac{1}{p}, \frac{1}{q}, \frac{1}{s})$
4. Multiply $\displaystyle (\frac{1}{p}, \frac{1}{q}, \frac{1}{s}) \cdot \text{LCD}(\frac{1}{p}, \frac{1}{q}, \frac{1}{s})$

### Vector Characterization of Direction

$$|\bar{r}| = [xyz]$$

where $\text{xyz}$ is the vector perpendicular to the surface of the crystal plane.
