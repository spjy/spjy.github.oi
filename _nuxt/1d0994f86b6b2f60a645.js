It has three terminals, two inputs and one output, as seen in the figure:\n\n![opamp](/microelectronics/opamp.svg)\n\nAn op amp is operated by DC power supplies with one rail connected to positive voltage and the other connected to negative voltage.\n\n## Ideal Operation Amplifier Model\n\nWe can assume four characteristics of an ideal op amp:\n\n1. $i_{input} = 0 \\implies R_i \\rightarrow \\infty$. No current flows into the input terminals, thus the input impedance is infinite.\n2. $v_o = A(v_2-v_1) \\implies R_o \\rightarrow 0$. The output terminal acts like an ideal voltage source, where $v_o = A(v_2-v_1)$, so the output impedance is zero.\n3. Bandwidth $\\rightarrow \\infty$. In other words, the op amp can amplify signals at any frequency with equal gain.\n4. Infinite Open Loop Gain. $A \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n4. Infinite Common Mode Rejection, so $v_1=v_2$ assuming the differential gain $A \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n    * $\\displaystyle \\lim_{A \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{v_o}{A} = v_2 - v_1 \\implies v_1 = v_2$.\n    * Common mode rejection is the amplifier's ability to rid of the common mode voltage. In other words, if an ideal op amp removed all of the common mode voltage, then say $v_1=v_2=1v$. \n    \n    $$v_o = A(v_2-v_1) = A(1 - 1) = 0$$\n\n### Differential & Common Mode Signals\n\n#### Differential Input\n- The difference between the input signals $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n\n$$v_{Id} = v_2 - v_1$$\n\n#### Common Mode Input\n- The average of the input signals $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n\n$$v_{Icm}=\\frac{1}{2} (v_1+v_2)$$\n\n### Closed Loop Gain\n\n$$G \\equiv \\frac{v_O}{v_I}$$\n\n# MOSFETs\nA MOSFET is a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) field effect transistor (FET). It is a two terminal semiconductor device that is often utilized in integrated circuits. \n\n## N-channel MOS\nThe N-channel MOS is one that has a heavily doped n-channel regions in the source and drain regions.
