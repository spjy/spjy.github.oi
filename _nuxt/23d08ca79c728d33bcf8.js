The charge of an electron is often denoted as the constant value:\n\n$$e = -1.602 \\times 10^{-19} C$$\n\nNote:\n1. In $1\\text{C}$ of charge, there are $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} = 6.24 \\times 10^{18}$ electrons.\n2. The charges that occur in nature are integral multiples of the electric charge $e$.\n3. The law of conservation of charge states charge cannot be created or destroyed.\n\n# Current (i)\n\nCurrent is the time rate of change of charge and is represented as the variable $i$. Its unit of measurement is denoted as amperes (A). An ampere is equivilent to a $\\text{coulomb / second}$.\n\n$$i = \\frac{dq}{dt}$$\n\nThe charge transferred between two time points is denoted as:\n\n$$q = \\int_{t_0}^t i \\text{ } dt$$\n\n## Types of Currents\n\n#### Direct Current (DC)\n\nDC current is one that flows in only one direction.\n\n#### Alternating Current (AC)\n\nAC current is one that changes direction with respect to time.\n\n# Voltage (v)\n\nVoltage is the potential difference between two points and is reepreseented as the variable $v$. In other words, it is the energy required to move from one point $a$ to another point $b$. Its unit of measurement is denoted as volts (V). A volt is equivilent to a $\\text{joule / coulomb}$ or a $\\text{newton} \\cdot \\text{meter / coulomb}$. Voltage is denoted as change in work over the change in charge:\n\n$$v_{ab} = \\frac{dw}{dq}$$\n\nThis means that a volt would deliver one joule of energy when one coulomb passes through a load.\n\n# Power (p)\n\nPower is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy and is represented as the variable $p$. Its unit of measurement is denoted as watts (W). A watt is equivilent to one $\\text{joule / second}$.\n\n$$p=\\frac{dw}{dt}=vi$$\n\nConversely, we can calculate the energy absorbed:\n\n$$w=\\int_{t_0}^t p \\text{ } dt = \\int_{t_0}^t vi \\text{ } dt$$\n\nNote:\n1. Positive power means power ($p=+vi$) is being absorbed.\n2. Negative power means power ($p=-vi$) is being released.\n3. The law of conservation of power states energy cannot be created or destroyed.\n\n# Energy (w)\n\nEnergy is the ability to do work and is measured in joules (J).\n\n# Circuit Elements\n\nAn electric circuit is a collection of connected elements.\n\n## Types of Circuit Elements\n\n#### Passive Circuit Element\nA passive circuit element is not capable of generating electricity.\n\n#### Active Circuit Element\nA passive circuit element is capable of generating electricity.\n\n## Types of Sources\n\n#### Ideal Independent Source\nAn ideal independent source is an active circuit element that provides a pre-determined voltage or current independent of other circuit elements.\n\n#### Ideal Dependent Source\nAn ideal dependent source is an active circuit element where the voltage or current is determined by its surrounding circuit elements.\n\n# Resistance (R)\nThe resistance is the ability for an element to resist the flow of charge and is denoted by the variable $R$. Its unit of measure is ohms ($\\Omega$). An ohm is equivilent to one $\\text{volt / amp}\n\nIt depends on the material's length ($l$), cross sectional area ($A$) and resistivity ($\\rho$).\n\n$$R=\\rho \\frac{l}{A}$$\n\nNote:\n1. When $\\displaystyle i=\\lim_{R \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{v}{R}=0$, or an element has no resistance, it is said to be a short circuit.\n2. When $R=\\infty$, or an element has infinite resistance, it is said to be an open circuit.\n\n# Ohms Law\nOhm's law states voltage and current are directly proportional.\n\n$$v=iR$$\n\n# Circuit Topology\n\n#### Branch (b)\nA branch is a circuit element.\n\n#### Node (n)\nA node is a connection between two branches.\n\n#### Loop (l)\nA loop is a closed path within the circuit.\n\nBranches, nodes and loops are connected by the equation:\n\n$$b=l+n-1$$\n\nNote:\n1. If 2+ branches share a single node, they are said to be in series and have the same current.\n2. If 2+ branches share 2+ nodes, they are said to be in parallel and have the same voltage.\n\n# Kirchhoff's Laws\n\n#### Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)\nThe sum of currents entering a node is zero.\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^N i_n=0$$\n\n#### Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)\nThe sum of voltages around a loop is zero.\n\n$$\\sum_{m=1}^M v_m=0$$\n\n# Equivilent Resistance\n\n#### Series Resistance Addition\nFor resistors in series, the equivilent resistance is merely the sum of each resistance. For $n$ resistors in series:\n\n$$R_{eq}=\\sum_{n=1}^N R_n$$\n\n#### Parallel Resistance Addition\nFor resistors in parallel, the equivilent resistance is the product of each resistance divided by their sum. For $n$ resistors in parallel:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\\frac{1}{R_{1}} + \\frac{1}{R_{2}} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{R_{n}}$$\n\n# Voltage Division\nFor $N$ resistors in series with a source voltage $v$, the $n$th resistor has the voltage drop of:\n\n$$\\displaystyle v_n=\\frac{R_n}{R_1+R_2+\\ldots+R_N} v$$\n\n# Current Division\nFor two resistors in parallel attached to a current source $i$, the current over resistor $R_1$ is:\n\n$$\\displaystyle i_1=\\frac{R_2 \\text{ } i}{R_1+R_2}$$\n\n# Wye-Delta Transformations\nResistors can appear in configuration that is not in parallel or series. Wye-Delta ($Y-\\Delta$) transformations solve this issue of combining resistors when this situation arises.\n\n$Y$ / $T$ configuration:\n\n![wye](/ee/wye.svg)\n![T](/ee/T.svg)\n\n$$R_{12}(Y)=R_1+R_3$$\n\n$\\Delta$ / $\\Pi$  configuration:\n\n![delta](/ee/delta.svg)\n![pi](/ee/pi.svg)\n\n$$R_{12}(\\Delta)=R_b || (R_a+R_c)$$\n\nA $Y$ resistor configuration can be re-arranged into a $\\Pi$ resistor configuration, while the $\\Delta$ resistor configuration can be re-arranged to look like a $T$. This is called the $\\Pi-T$ configuration.\n\nFor a $\\Delta \\rightarrow Y$ transformation:\n\n$$R_1=\\frac{R_b R_c}{R_a+R_b+R_c}$$\n$$R_2=\\frac{R_c R_a}{R_a+R_b+R_c}$$\n$$R_3=\\frac{R_a R_b}{R_a+R_b+R_c}$$\n\nFor a $Y \\rightarrow \\Delta$ transformation:\n\n$$R_a = \\frac{R_1R_2+R_2R_3+R_3R_1}{R_1}$$\n$$R_b = \\frac{R_1R_2+R_2R_3+R_3R_1}{R_2}$$\n$$R_c = \\frac{R_1R_2+R_2R_3+R_3R_1}{R_3}$$\n\n# Circuit Analysis Techniques\n\n#### Nodal Analysis\nUse Kirchhoff's Current Law at a node.\n\n#### Mesh Analysis\nUse Kirchhoff's Voltage Law around a loop.\n\n#### Superposition\n\n\n\n"}}]);
